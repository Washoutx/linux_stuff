/proc/sys/vm/swappiness is a heuristic parameter that controls the kernel's tendency to move pages from RAM to swap space. 
Its value ranges from 0 to 100, with a default of 60. Higher values make the system more likely to move inactive pages to swap, 
while lower values make the system prefer to keep pages in RAM as long as possible.

dirty pages - memory pages in RAM which are modified and not sync with memory on hard drive.
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs - lifetime of dirty page
